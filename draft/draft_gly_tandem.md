**Abstract**

Parthenogenesis and the loss of males have occurred repeatedly across
diverse organisms. However, asexual reproduction is not usually
associated with social animals that exhibit biparental care because such
care is inherently linked to the behavioral sequence of mate pairing and
sexual reproduction. The male-less termite, *Glyptotermes nakajimai*,
provides a rare opportunity to study how sexual reproduction can be lost
in social animals with parental care. Here we demonstrate that
modification of the mate-pairing process impeded the evolution of
asexual lineages. Termite colonies are typically founded by a mating
pair, with many species forming a tandem courtship pair while searching
for a nest site. Our comparative analysis of tandem running in
*Glyptotermes* termites revealed that two related species, *G. fuscus*
and *G. satsumensis*, exhibited both female-leader and male-leader
tandem runs, estimated to be the ancestral state in this genus. On the
other hand, tandem running was rare and ephemeral in both sexual and
asexual lineages of *G. nakajimai*. These results suggest that *G.
nakajimai* employs an alternative colony foundation strategy, as further
supported by their colony structures. Our study highlights the close
link between the evolution of asexuality and behavioral preadaptation,
contributing to our understanding of the evolution of complex
phenotypes.

**Memo for introduction**

There are two different potential behavioral preadaptations that enable
the evolution of a male-less colony foundation in termites.

1\. Same-sex tandem runs, female-female tandem runs

2\. Colony foundation by multiple individuals, pairing not based on
tandem running.

**Idea of another result to be shown.**

I want to show that the colonies of G. nakajimai include many
reproductives (not a pair) \[1\], while colonies of G. fuscus and G.
satsumensis often have just monogamous pairs (often physogastric). This
is consistent with my observation, but my data is minimal as I have not
recorded it properly. The former is shown in the paper \[1\], but we do
not have published information on the latter.

Here are some possible approaches:

Based on this project report (you can read this in English from this
link:
<https://koara.lib.keio.ac.jp/xoonips/modules/xoonips/detail.php?koara_id=2018000005-20180253>),
G. satsumensis keeps monogamous pairing. However, this report is not
published (or looks like will not be published in the future). We may
reach out Hayashi-san to ask if he has any data about colony structures
in G. satsumensis. If so, we can ask if he can join this paper.

We can also reach out Yashiro-san if he have data.

Do you have any thoughts/ideas?
