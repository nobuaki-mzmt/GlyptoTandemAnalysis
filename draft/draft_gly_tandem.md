**Abstract**

Parthenogenesis and the loss of males have occurred repeatedly across
diverse organisms. Yet, asexually reproducing lineages are not usually
associated with social animals that exhibit biparental care because such
care is inherently linked to the behavioral sequence of mate pairing and
sexual reproduction. The male-less lineages of the termite,
*Glyptotermes nakajimai*, provide a rare opportunity to study how sexual
reproduction can be lost in social animals with parental care. Here we
demonstrate that modification of the mate-pairing process predated the
evolution of asexual lineages. Termite colonies are typically founded by
a mating pair, with many species forming a tandem courtship pair while
searching for a nest site. Our comparative analysis of tandem running in
*Glyptotermes* termites revealed that two related species, *G. fuscus*
and *G. satsumensis*, exhibited both female-leader and male-leader
tandem runs, estimated to be the ancestral state in this genus. On the
other hand, tandem running was rare and ephemeral in both sexual and
asexual lineages of *G. nakajimai*. These results suggest that *G.
nakajimai* employs an alternative colony foundation strategy, as further
supported by their colony structures. Our study highlights the tight
link between the evolution of asexuality and behavioral preadaptation,
contributing to our understanding of the evolution of complex
phenotypes.

**Significance statement**

The evolution of the unique form of animal society requires
modifications of a facet of physiological and behavioral phenotypes.
Unlike social Hymenoptera, termites represent a bisexual insect society
that stems from biparental care. In this study, we demonstrated the
behavioral preadaptation towards the evolution of a male-less society in
a termite, *Glyptotermes nakajimai*. Our combination of movement
trajectory analysis with posture tracking and phylogenetic comparative
analysis revealed that loss of monogamous pair formation was a
prerequisite of the male-less society in termites. We conclude that the
evolutionary loss of males can be possible in animals with biparental
care with the large changes in mating systems.

**Introduction**

Sexual reproduction is the norm for multicellular organisms despite the
costs of producing males (1, 2). Many studies have revealed the
advantages of sexual reproduction in short and long periods (e.g., (3)).
Furthermore, in established sexual species, there are developmental and
genetic constraints, such as egg activation and inbreeding depression,
to prevent the evolution of asexuality by maintaining a low transition
rate from sexual to asexual reproduction (4). Therefore, although
asexual reproduction evolved across the diversity of taxa, the evolution
of the asexual population is relatively rare. In addition to genetic
mechanisms, specific behaviors of sexual organisms can prevent the
evolution of asexual lineages, such as sexual conflicts (5) (but see
(6)). Among behavioral traits, the evolution of asexuality is
challenging in social animals with biparental care, where males
contribute to parental care beyond providing sperm (1, 7). Such
biparental social systems are in contrast with social Hymenoptera, with
many examples of male-less lineages (e.g., (8–10)). In social
Hymenoptera, mating and parental care are often disconnected, where
parental care is only maternal, and queens can store the male’s sperm
for her entire lifetime after one mating before the colony foundation
(11). Furthermore, as a haplodiploid animal, all social Hymenoptera use
(arrhenotokous) parthenogenesis for male production, reducing a hurdle
for male-less populations. On the other hand, in a diploid and
both-sexed society, sexual reproduction is closely linked to the
sequence of mate pairing and biparental care, incorporating males as an
integral part of the social structure.

Unlike social Hymenoptera, termites represent a bisexual society with
female and male workers and a king and a queen within their colony.
Termites evolved from the ancestor of wood-feeding cockroaches, whose
colonies are initiated from subsocial pairs (12, 13). Mature termite
colonies release alates (winged reproductives) in a synchronized manner,
and alates fly off to disperse and find a mating partner (14). After
shedding wings, many termite species form tandem pairing; a female and a
male walk together while searching for a nest site (15). During the
initial phases of colony foundation, males significantly contribute to
the offspring energetically and through physical labor (16, 17). Also,
survival and successful colony foundation only stem from pair formation
because termites require a partner for allogrooming (18, 19). Therefore,
although termite queens with parthenogenetic ability could, in theory,
reproduce alone (20–22), they need a partner for the colony foundation.

A Japanese drywood termite, *Glyptotermes nakajimai* Morimoto (Isoptera:
Kalotermitidae) (23, 24), provides a rare opportunity to study the
evolution of asexual lineages in animals with biparental care. In
several populations, males have been completely lost, resulting in
male-less asexual societies (25), where the ancestral hybridization of
two sexual lineages gave rise to the asexual lineages (26). The
evolutionary loss of males in termite societies requires overcoming
several challenges. In the first place, the ancestral sexual population
must have had the capacity for parthenogenesis (or at least
tychoparthenogenesis: occasional egg development without fertilization)
as a preadaptation (27). While tychoparthenogenesis is an essential
precursor to asexuality, it is not sufficient on its own, given that
many other termite species exhibit parthenogenesis (or
tychoparthenogenesis) without evolving into fully asexual lineages (21,
28). Additionally, because biparental care is integral to termite colony
cycles, transitioning to an asexual population likely required
modifications to the typical monogamous colony foundation observed in
termites.

From the field observations, *G. nakajimai* colonies are often headed by
multiple reproductives (25). Such pleometrosis (colony foundation by
multiple kings and queens) can facilitate the evolution of an asexual
society by securing sufficient colony foundation partners. However, it
remains unknown how termites achieved such a largely modified colony
foundation from a typical monogamous pairing (Fig. 1). Two potential
behavioral preadaptations enable the evolution of a male-less colony
foundation in termites. (*i*) Same-sex tandem runs: female-female pairs
can establish colonies following same-sex tandem running. In
*Reticulitermes* termites, for example, such same-sex tandems are as
stable as heterosexual pairs (15, 29), and they can initiate colonies
via parthenogenesis (19, 30) though their long-term success is limited
(31–33). Same-sex tandem running varies widely across species (34),
implying that the ancestor of *G. nakajimai* lineages might have
exhibited strong tandem running behavior, including same-sex pairing,
where multiple same-sex pairs can result in pleometrosis. Under this
scenario, a transition of asexuality could have occurred without largely
modifying mate pairing behaviors. (*ii*) Non-pairing behavior: termites
might have lost typical tandem pairing behavior as a preadaptation so
that they can achieve pleometrosis directly without pair formations. In
this scenario, *G. nakajimai* may have largely modified their ancestral
pairing and colony foundation processes from other termite lineages.
This highlights the uniqueness of *G. nakajimai* and the evolutionary
challenges of a male-less society in termites. A comparative analysis of
tandem running behavior and mating systems both across *Glyptotermes*
species and across entire termite diversity can test these ideas.

In this study, we investigated the mate-pairing process of three
different *Glyptotermes* species (*G. nakajimai, G. fuscus* Oshima*, G.
satsumensis* (Matsumura)). These three species can be found
sympatrically and relatively closely related to each other (23, 35), but
asexual society only arose in *G. nakajimai*. We especially focused on
tandem running behavior by automatically quantifying it using the
deep-leaning automated posture-tracking software (36). We also described
their colony breeding structures from the field observations. Then, we
estimated their phylogenetic relationships and divergence times from
mitochondrial genomes. By using the updated phylogeny and
literature-based datasets, we mapped the tandem running behavior and
mating systems across termite diversity to reconstruct the evolution of
male-less societies through the lens of behavior.

**Results and Discussion**

*The tandem pairing behavior in* Glyptotermes *species is diverse*

Tandem running behavior was clearly observed in *G. fuscus* and *G.
satsumensis*, while it was lacking in *G. nakajimai* from both sexual
and asexual populations (Figs. 2 and 3).

First, these species showed distinct patterns in pair positioning when
we observed behavioral interactions of mating pairs (or female-female
pairs in asexual populations) in a pest dish arena. When
species-specific datasets were pooled, pairs were often found to be
within two body length distances across all species, where data
distribution seemed to follow different patterns within or beyond two
body lengths (Fig. 2AC), indicating that termites dealates interact when
within two body lengths.

Second, when termites were within two body lengths, the spatial
orientations of pairs differed across species. In *G. satsumensis*,
pairs were often positioned in a line, with the female either in front
or behind the male (Fig. 2AB) —*i.e.*, they exhibit both female-led and
male-led tandems. In *G. fuscus*, similarly positioned in a line,
tandems were more frequently male-led (Fig. 2AB). In contrast, we could
not observe a clear positioning in *G. nakajimai*, with neither a leader
nor a follower, in either sexual or asexual populations (Fig. 2AB). We
used these observations for defining tandem runs; partners were in
interaction when the distance was within two body lengths, and during
interactions, pairs were in tandem runs when the female was in front of
the male and the male was behind the female (and vice versa).

Next, we looked into the details of the pairwise interactions for each
pair. Tandem running behavior was highly variable across different
pairs, even within species (Fig. 3A); some pairs showed tandem runs
during entire observations, while some did not form tandem runs during
the observation period. However, long tandem running (e.g., more than
40% of the observational time) was only observed in *G. satsumensis*
(7/21) and *G. fuscus* (8/46), not in *G. nakajimai*. There was no
significant difference in the proportion of the time for tandem running
behavior among species (GLMM, χ<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub> = 3.74, *P* =
0.291). Within each species, there were differences in the proportion of
time spent in tandem runs, where the female-led tandem run was more
common than male-led in *G. satsumensis* (GLMM,
χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 22.92, *P* \< 0.001), while male-led tandem
runnings were more common than female-led tandem runnings in *G. fuscus*
(χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 26118, *P* \< 0.001) or *G. nakajimai*
(χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 497.38, *P* \< 0.001). Thus, the male is
the more active sex (i.e., the follower) for pairing in *G.
satsumensis*, while the female is the more active sex for pairing in *G.
fuscus* and *G. nakajimai*.

*Sexual and asexual lineages of* G. nakajimai *do not maintain tandem
runs*

The function of tandem running behavior is to maintain pair cohesion
while exploring the environments for finding a nesting site. Therefore,
it should be evaluated as the distance a pair moved during a continuous
interacting event rather than the duration they spent in the posture of
following the other. When we compared the traveled distance, we found
that *G. satsumensis* and *G. fuscus* traveled a longer distance than
*G. nakajimai* (Fig. 3; Cox mixed effect model, male leader,
χ<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub> = 30.19, *P* \< 0.001, female leader,
χ<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub> = 17.56, *P* \< 0.001). In this sense,
although *G. nakajimai* showed ephemeral tandem runs, their
functionality is questioned —with their longest tandem breaking up after
running only 185 mm (sexual) and 260 mm (asexual). Given that these
species initiate their nest in tree branches, they cannot explore many
options during tandem running. On the other hand, tandem running of *G.
satsumensis* and *G. fuscus* can travel for more than 1000 mm long in 24
events continuously (15: *G. fuscus*, 9: *G. satsumensis*, from 16
pairs, 11: *G. fuscus*, 5: *G. satsumensis*). This allows them to
explore the tree branches thoroughly. Within these species, there were
no significant functional differences between female-led and male-led
tandem runs (Cox mixed effect model, *G. fuscus*;
χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 2.41, *P* = 0.121, *G. satsumensis*;
χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 0.14, *P* = 0.704).

*Ancestral state of tandem running behavior*

Tandem running behavior is highly variable in Kalotermitidae termites
(15). Genus-level ancestral state reconstruction and fossil record
suggested that the ancestor of Kalotermitidae exhibited tandem running
(15, 37). Yet, some species show tandem running, while others do not
even within the same genus. In *Glyptotermes*, *G. nakajimai* does not
show tandem running, while *G. fuscus* and *G. satsumensis* do (Fig. 2
and 3). These suggest two evolutionary processes of tandem running in
termites: 1) tandem running behavior can exhibit greater evolvability
and have readily evolutionary modifications in Kalotermitidae more than
the other lineage; 2) even with the high evolvability, the tandem
pairing was lost before the evolution of male-less society in *G.
nakajimai*. We test these hypotheses using a comparative phylogenetic
framework. To reconstruct the evolutionary process of tandem running, we
performed the species-level ancestral state reconstruction using the
mitochondrial genome phylogeny and published datasets.

By fitting various evolutionary models for tandem running evolution, we
found that the evolutionary rate of tandem running behavior is distinct
between Kalotermitidae (+ other basal lineages) and Neoisoptera,
representing two major termite groups in their diversity (Figs. S1 and
4). The best-fit model was a hidden rate model (38), where the
female-leader state has two states: one can easily change its state,
while the other loses evolutionary variability (Fig. S1). Although
female-leader tandem running can be observed in Kalotermitidae, these
female-leader tandems were estimated as an evolutionary variable (Fig.
S1). In contrast, female-leader tandems in Neoisoptera were estimated to
be evolutionarily fixed (Fig. S1). Thus, the tandem running behavior of
Kalotermitidae is indeed variable and readily experiences evolutionary
changes. The ancestral state of Kalotermitidae might have tandem running
but cannot be certainly estimated (Figs. S1 and 4); it lacked tandem
running in 32%, while it could exhibit tandem running in 68% either as
female leader (29%), male leader (11%), or both leader (28%). Note that
this information may be conservative as our estimation lacks fossil
evidence of tandem running of *Electrotermes affinis*, an extinct
kalotermitid termite with tandem running behavior (37).

Similar to the ancestor of Kalotermitidae, the ancestral state of
*Glyptotermes* was also ambiguous but more likely doing tandems (Figs.
S1 and 4). The ancestral state was estimated as lacking tandem running
at 38%, while exhibiting tandem running at 62% either as female leader
(11%), male leader (2%), or both leader (42%). However, the ancestral
state of *G. nakajimai* was clearly estimated as lacking tandem running
behavior in 93% (Figs. S1 and 4). Therefore, we conclude that the loss
of tandem pairing should have predated the evolution of a male-less
society in *G. nakajimai* (Fig. 1 *ii*).

*Evolution of the mating system co-work with the loss of tandem running
toward a male-less society*

In *G. nakajimai*, colonies often include many alate-derived
reproductives in both sexual and asexual populations (25). Colony
foundation by multiple queens has been observed in asexual populations
(no data is available in sexual populations) (25). Such pleometrosis
(colony foundation by more reproductives than a pair) may have
contributed to removing a barrier to the evolution of asexuality as they
can achieve alloparental care without males (Fig. 1). To investigate how
such pleometrosis (or having multiple primary reproductives) is
distributed among termite diversity and contributes to the evolution of
a male-less society, we also performed phylogenetic comparative analyses
of the mating systems (Fig. 4A). We investigated the colony structure of
*G. fuscus* and *G. satsumensis* from field observations (Table S1).
Also, we compiled information about the number of reproductives in the
nest for the species with the available tandem running information by
performing a systematic search of the literature (Table S2).

First, in *Glyptotermes*, mature colonies of *G. fuscus* and *G.
satsumensis* often included multiple reproductives (Table S1, Fig. 4B).
The total number of reproductives was variable across species (GLM,
χ<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub> = 188.7, *P* \< 0.001), where sexual
populations of *G. nakajimai* had more reproductives than others
(Tukey’s posthoc *P* \< 0.001), and there was no significant difference
among asexual populations of *G. nakajimai,* *G. fuscus,* and *G.
satsumensis* (Tukey’s posthoc). However, the source of such multiple
reproductives in mature colonies could have differed from *G. nakajimai*
and the other two species. Incipient colonies of *G. nakajimai* already
had multiple queens (25), while incipient colonies of *G. fuscus* or *G.
satsumensis* were monogamous pairs (pair: 3/3 in *G. fuscus* and 4/4 in
*G. satsumensis*, Table S1, Fig. 4B). Actually, the number of
reproductives was larger in mature colonies than in incipient colonies
in *G. fuscus* (GLM, χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 6.93, *P* = 0.008), but
not in *G. satsumensis* (GLM, χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 1.3, *P* =
0.255). Colony fusion could explain the occurrence of multiple
reproductives in mature nests after initial colony foundations by
independent monogamous pairs in the same branch. However, colony fusion
often causes competition between reproductives and results in pair
formation in many other species (e.g., (18, 39, 40)). In this sense,
*Glyptotermes* termites might be tolerant to the presence of other
reproductive, which may have played a role in facilitating the evolution
of pleometrosis in this group.

Next, this observation in *Glyptotermes* species is further supported by
a large-scale comparative analysis of the mating systems (Fig. 4A and
Table S2). Across termite diversity, having multiple reproductives in
the colony is rare. Pleometrosis has been observed in several species of
Termitidae (41–43). However, even in these species, both monogamous and
pleometrosis can be observed in a mixed way, highlighting the uniqueness
of *Glyptotermes,* which has multiple primary reproductives in most
colonies. In Kalotermitidae, the available records show that primary
reproductives were usually in monogamous pairs (e.g., (44, 45)), and the
ancestral state of Kalotermitidae was estimated as monogamous in both
the colony foundation stage and mature colonies (the probability of
monogamous was 89% for incipient and 98 for mature; Fig. 4A). On the
other hand, the ancestral state of *Glyptotermes* was estimated to have
multiple primary reproductives in mature colonies (94%, Fig. 4) but not
in incipient colony (11%). So, within *Glyptotermes* termites, there was
a correlation between pair formation behavior and colony foundation unit
in the studied species; *G. fuscus* and *G. satsumensis* exhibited
tandem running and monogamous colony foundation, while *G. nakajimai*
lacked them. The combination of characteristics of tandem running and
the mating system was unique in *G. nakajimai*, which lacked tandem
running, started colonies from multiple reproductives and had the
ability of parthenogenesis (Fig. 4A). In this group, the modification of
pair formation (lack of tandem run and pleometrosis) should have
predated the male-less society (Figs 1 and 4).

It remains unclear whether tandem pair formation necessarily leads to
monogamous pairing. For example, although some other Kalotermitidae
species (e.g., *Neotermes, Pterotermes, Cryptotermes*) lack tandem
running behavior (46–48), these showed strict monogamous pairing (44,
45). Yet, we speculate that loss of tandem running should be the
prerequisite to achieving pleometrosis as a default unit, as in *G.
nakajimai*. Tandem running behavior is essentially a pairing behavior,
and runs with more than three individuals are unstable (15, 29, 49). For
example, in Macrotermitinae termites, such as *Odontotermes* or
*Macrotermes*, it is relatively common to find colonies with more than
two primary reproductives (41) (Table S2). Still, in these species,
monogamous pairing is also common. In either situation, resource
limitation should facilitate pleometrosis (50). When the nesting site is
a limited and valuable resource, termite dealates must concentrate and
be forced to start a colony with many individuals. The distribution of
*G. nakajimai* is highly localized; this species is usually rarer than
other species and can be found within the narrow area near the tips of
the capes (especially in asexual populations). The particular
requirements of a site of colony foundation should have contributed to
the pleometrosis observed in *G. nakajimai*.

***Conclusion***

Parthenogenesis ability has evolved independently many times in termites
(21, 22, 28), but asexual society only happens in *G. nakajimai* as far
as we know. We attributed this rarity to the complex combination of
required preadaptations, including lack of tandem running and
pleometrosis. It is especially required to largely modify the typical
monogamous mating process in termites (Fig. 1), highlighting the
uniqueness of the evolution of a male-less society in *G. nakajimai*.
For example, *Reticulitermes* termites and several other termites
incorporate facultative parthenogenesis into their colony reproductive
system and life history (28, 51). Also, these species show female-female
pairing and colony foundation (52), although female-female pairs do not
result in functional colonies in a long timeline (31, 32). These species
ultimately use strict social monogamy, where the presence of multiple
kings or queens leads to competition and a monogamous pair. Also, the
male is evolutionarily fixed to be the active sex of tandem pairing
(Fig. S1), which also hinders the evolution of asexuality. Note that *G.
fuscus*, a sister species of *G. nakajimai*, shows tandem running but
the active sex is the female, which also should have contributed to the
evolutionary loss of males. Similarly, *Neotermes sugioi* shows
facultative parthenogenesis and even lacks tandem running behavior (46,
53). However, this species also shows strict monogamous pairing,
implying a strong sexual selection from the male to maintain monogamous
pairing.

Sexual reproduction is the norm in animal kingdoms, and the evolution of
asexuality does not happen randomly across lineages because each group
has a specific unique hurdle to overcome during male loss (2, 4). Many
theoretical studies of the evolution of sexuality have acknowledged that
parental care by males can minimize the cost of sexual reproduction.
Thus, evolutionary change of behavior should accompany such species. In
this study, we showed that mate pairing behavior went through several
steps of preadaptations in the course of the evolutionary loss of males
in a termite, *G. nakajimai*. This highlights the importance of
behavioral preadaptation as a prerequisite for the evolution of
asexuality in social animals. By focusing on the behavioral aspects of
sexual and asexual evolution, our results shed light on the integrative
approach to the evolution of the sex.

**Methods**

*Termite collection*

We collected all termite colonies from the field with a piece of nesting
wood. We collected three colonies of *G. fuscus* in Okinawa Prefecture
(one in January 2021 and one in March 2022 in Nago; one in March 2023,
Iriomote Is.), three colonies of *G. satsumensis* in March 2021 (two in
Minamiosumi, Kagoshima, one in Kushima, Miyazaki), and four colonies of
*G. nakajimai* (two in March 2021, Wakasa, Fukui, one in April 2023,
Tokunoshima Is. Kagoshima, one in March 2021 in Cape Toi, Miyazaki). The
populations of *G. nakajimai* from Fukui prefecture and Tokunoshima
Island are sexually reproducing (54), while the Cape Toi population is
asexually reproducing (25). The field collection was performed before
the swarming season in March-June, depending on the location (23, 54);
each colony contained nymphs but not alates. All colonies were
maintained within the nesting wood at 22°C until the experiments. Before
each experiment, we transferred nests to a room at 27 °C, which promoted
alates to emerge and fly. Nests were also opened with axes, and flying
alates were collected. Alates were induced to shed their wings by
manually pinching their wings with forceps. Dealates were maintained in
Petri dishes containing moist, unwoven cloth in the light and used for
the experiments within one day of flight. Dealates were separated by sex
and color-marked with one dot of paint (PX-20; Mitsubishi) on the
abdomen to distinguish sex identities.

*Behavioral observations*

We introduced a female-male pair of termite dealates (female-female pair
for an asexual population of *G. nakajimai*) to the experimental arena,
consisting of a petri dish (φ = 90 mm) covered with a layer of moistened
plaster. All pairs were prepared using nest mates. The effect of
intracolonial and intercolonial pairing on tandem running behavior is
not known for *Glyptotermes* species. We consistently used nest-mate
pairing for valid cross-species comparisons. Note that tandem running is
not different between nestmate and non-nestmate pairing in
*Reticulitermes speratus* (15). This species is not closely related to
*Glyptotermes*, so we cannot fully rule out the possibility that the
nestmate and non-nest mate showed different tandem running. However, our
species comparison is at least consistent across species by using only
nest-mate pairing. We recorded their behavior for up to 60 minutes at 30
frames per second. Videos were cropped to 1200x1200 pixels to include
only the arena in the frame before the video analysis. In total, we
observed 21 pairs of *G. satsumensis* (340:16, 347:2, JP21-06:3), 46
pairs of *G. fuscus* (21A:16, G05:18, NM2325:12), 25 pairs of *G.
nakajimai* sexual populations (356:6, 367:3, NM2344:16), and 15 pairs of
asexual populations.

All videos were analyzed using SLEAP v 1.4.0 (36) to estimate the
movement of body parts of each individual. We used a 6-node skeleton:
antenna tips (LR), head (middle of mouth parts), head-pronotum boundary,
body center, abdomen-tip, and a dot of a color-painted marker. We built
a model for one species and then used it as a starting point to build
another for the next species sequentially. First, we labeled 342
individuals from 23 videos for training in *G. satsumensis*. We trained
a U-Net-based model with a multi-animal top-down approach, with a
receptive field size of 76 pixels for the centroid and 156 pixels for
the centered instance, on Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090, where augmentation is
done by rotating images from -180 to 180 degrees. The mean Average
Precision (mAP) and mean Average Recall (mAR) of this model were 0.36
and 0.49, respectively. While tracking after the inference, we used the
instance similarity method with the greedy matching method. All pose
estimation data were converted to HDF5 files for further analysis. Then,
we used the model for *G. satsumensis* as a starting point and developed
a model for *G. fuscus* with 956 individuals from 37 videos. This model
was further fine-tuned by only using labels for each colony. Similarly,
the models of *G. nakajimai* were trained based on this *G. fuscus*
model for each colony.

We used Python to format all HDF5 files for further analysis and
converted them into FEATHER files for analysis in R (55). We employed a
linear interpolation method to address missing values in the dataset.
After scaling all data from pixels to mm (1200 pixels = arena size), we
used a median filter with a kernel size of 5 to reduce noise.

To compare tandem running behaviors among species, we automatically
determined whether pairs were in tandem based on the postures and
spatial position of partners. First, we regarded as two individuals
being in interaction when the distance between the body centers of
partners was less than two body lengths, based on the frequency
distribution of this distance (Fig. 1C). In this process, we ignored the
short interaction events or non-interaction events less than 2 seconds
to smooth the data. Second, during interactions, we classified termite
heading orientation as female-leader and male-leader. We obtained the
heading directions of females and males as vectors from the abdomen tips
to the head front. Then, a pair was in the female leader when the male
was behind relative to the female heading direction, and the female was
front relative to the male heading direction, and vice versa (Fig. 1AB).
If a pair spent more than half of the time in a female-leader position
during an interaction event, we regarded the interaction event as a
female-leader tandem run. This classified all frames into female-leader
tandem, male-leader tandem, other interactions (including tandem runs
where they switch leader-follower roles), and non-interactions. We
obtained the traveled distance for which the leader walked during each
tandem running event. Then, we compared this traveled distance, using
mixed-effects Cox models, with species being treated as a fixed effect
and each pair id as a random effect. We used the coxme() function in the
coxme package in R (56). Note that we used distance instead of duration
to evaluate how much tandem running pair could explore the environments
by removing pausing time during interactions.

*Molecular data processing*

We used mitochondrial genomes to reconstruct termites’ calibrated
phylogenetic trees with a focus on species and lineages with reviewed
data on tandem runs (15), while also encompassing all recognized extant
families and subfamilies *sensu* Hellemans *et al*. (57), Most
mitochondrial genomes used in this study have been previously published
(58–78) (Table S3).

We sequenced six additional samples from species with data on tandem
runs (Table SX1). Specimens were collected in Japan and preserved in
absolute ethanol stored at -20°C until DNA extraction. DNA was extracted
using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue extraction kit (Qiagen). Libraries were
prepared using the NEBNext Ultra™ II FS DNA Library Preparation Kit
(New England Biolabs) and the Unique Dual Indexing Kit (New England
Biolabs), with reagent volumes reduced to one-fifteenth of the
recommended volumes. Libraries were pooled in equimolar concentration,
and paired-end sequenced on the Novaseq platform at a read length of 150
bp.

Raw reads were trimmed from adapters and low-quality bases using fastp
*v*0.20.1 (79). Trimmed reads were assembled using metaSPAdes *v*3.13
(80), and mitochondrial scaffolds were identified and annotated using
MitoFinder *v*1.4 (81). The six mitogenomes produced herein were
deposited in GenBank under accessions XXX-XXX.

*Phylogenetic reconstructions*

Annotated mitochondrial features were separately aligned. For the 13
mitochondrial protein-coding genes, we translated DNA sequences into the
corresponding amino acid sequences using the transeq function from
EMBOSS *v*6.6.0 (82) and aligned protein sequences with MAFFT *v*7.305
(83). Protein alignments were back-translated into codon alignments
using PAL2NAL *v*14 (84). The two rRNA and 22 tRNA mitochondrial genes
were aligned as DNA sequences. All alignments were concatenated in a
supermatrix using FASconCAT-G_v1.04.pl (85). The mitochondrial
supermatrix was separated into five distinct partitions: combined rRNAs,
combined tRNAs, and combined first, second, and third codon positions of
protein-coding genes.

Time-calibrated phylogenetic trees (~~with and~~ without the third codon
positions partition) were reconstructed using BEAST v2.6.2 (86). Trees
and clock models were set as linked, while site models were kept
unlinked. A GTR+G model of nucleotide substitution was selected for all
partitions. The trees were given a Yule speciation process as prior. An
uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock was used to model rate variation
among branches (87). We used 12 fossils as minimum age constraints
(Table S4). Fossil calibrations were implemented as exponential priors
on node time with a 97.5% soft maximum bound (88). Minimum age
constraints and soft maximum bounds were obtained from PaleoBioDB
(<https://paleobiodb.org>; last accessed: 25/02/12). Additionally, we
constrained the (i) monophyly of Macrotermitinae + Sphaerotermitinae and
non-Macrotermitinae non-Sphaerotermitinae Termitidae, (ii) the
sistership of Stylotermitidae to all extant Neoisoptera, to match the
topology retrieved by genome-scale reconstructions (57, 66, 89). Markov
Chain Monte Carlo analyses were run for a total of 500 million
generations. Trees and parameters were sampled every 50,000 steps. We
visually inspected the trace file with Tracer v1.7 (90) and accordingly
used a burn-in of 20%. Maximum clade credibility trees with median
heights were obtained using TreeAnnotator (Supplementary Data 2 and 3).

*Ancestral state reconstruction of tandem running*

A previous study performed the ancestral state reconstruction of tandem
running behavior at the genus level (15). In this study, we extended
this reconstruction to the species level to infer the evolutionary
history of tandem running in *Glyptotermes*. We basically used the
dataset summarized in the previous study (15) with new information on
*Glyptotermes* species observed here (Figs. 2 and 3) but included
several modifications. First, we included *Hodotermopsis sjostedti*,
which exhibited tandem running with both females and males being
leaders. Second, we treated *Mastotermes darwiniensis* as lacking tandem
running. The tandem running of this species is based on the observation
of workers, which is not the same as the sexual behavior. Also, dealates
of this species do not show tandem running behavior. Note that treating
this species as tandem running with both female and male leaders did not
change our conclusion. Finally, in the dataset of the previous study
(15), some species show tandem running but lack the information of the
leader. We gave arbitrary values for these taxa, female-leader for
neoisopteran termites, and both-leader for other termites. The former is
based on the fact that all other neoisopteran termites show
female-leader tandem running. The latter is rather arbitrary, but
treating these as female-leader tandem running (which is more common in
termites in general) did not change our conclusions.

We carried out ancestral-state reconstructions by coding tandem running
behavior in four different states, without tandem running, female-leader
tandem running, male-leader tandem running, and tandem running with both
sexes being a leader. Another potential approach is to consider the two
different characteristics of female and male leaders. However, our
preliminary analysis with the function fitPagel() shows that these two
characters are dependent (*P* = 0.005). In this case, the combination of
these two states can be regarded as the same as the four-state model.

Observing the diversity of termite tandem running behavior, it is clear
that all neoisopteran termites exhibit female-leader tandem runs, while
tandem running is variable in other lineages (15). This can be because
neoisopteran termites developed a female-specific sex pheromone that may
make the evolutionary change of the sexual leader role less likely. On
the other hand, in other lineages, sex roles can easily evolutionarily
change, or tandem can even sometimes lose, as they do not have
sex-specific pheromones (91). Therefore, we assume that the
female-leader state has a hidden state (38), where one can easily change
their state, while the other loses evolutionary variability. We used a
hidden rate model to account for this issue (38).

We fitted a variety of models to examine the most feasible evolutionary
scenario. We fitted simple models without any hidden states, and with
different state transition patterns: all rates different model (‘ARD’
model) to allow independent estimates for transitions to and from the
three states; the all rates equal model (‘ER’ model), and a model
assuming symmetrical transition rates between states (“SYM” model’) to
estimate the ancestral state of this discrete trait. We used the fitMk()
function (pi = fitzjohn) of the R package “phytools” v2.4.4 (92). In
addition, we developed two hidden rate models, one with only female
leader tandem having hidden states and one with all traits having hidden
states. We used the ER model for the pattern of state transition. We
used the function fitHRM (pi = fitzjohn) in the same “phytools” package.
The Akaike information criterion (AICc) was used to compare models.

*Mating system*

Although termite colonies typically started from a monogamous pair, *G.
nakajimai* colonies often include multiple reproductives (25). To relate
the evolutionary process of tandem running with colony foundation
strategies, we performed the phylogenetic comparative analysis of mating
systems. We investigated if colonies of each termite species have a
monogamous pair (a king and a queen) or multiple reproductives. Even if
termite colonies started from a monogamous pair, the number of
reproductives can change over time due to, e.g., colony fusion. Thus, we
investigated the number of reproductives at two stages: during colony
foundation (or incipient colony) and mature colonies.

In termite colonies, there are two types of reproductives: adult
reproductives derived from alates, and neotenic, supplementary
reproductives only differentiated from the offspring of colony founders.
Adult reproductives usually originate from the colony founders. Thus, we
only focus on the number of adult reproductives in the colonies. Note
that there are several exceptional examples of adultoids, which are
supplemental reproductives derived from alates (93). Therefore, multiple
reproductives in mature colonies can either reflect pleometrosis (colony
foundation by multiple reproductives), colony fusion, or supplementary
adultoids.

We obtained the number of reproductives of *G. fuscus* and *G.
satsumensis* from the field observations using the same method as the
previous study (25). Three incipient and 15 mature colonies of *G*.
*fuscus* and four incipient and nine mature colonies of *G*.
*satsumensis* were collected from Shikoku, Kyushu, Amami-Oshima Island,
Okinawa Island, and Ogasawara Islands, Japan (Table S1). The nest woods
were dismantled, and all colony members, including queens and kings,
were extracted using an aspirator and forceps. In addition, we conducted
a literature survey on the species whose information on tandem running
is available (15). On the 15th and 16th of March 2025, we used the
online reference platform Google Scholar with the simple string function
and search strings: (Genus-name Species-name) AND (reproductives OR king
OR queen OR foundation). We used Google Scholar to collect as much
observational information on the number of reproductives as possible. We
focused on the field observations reporting the number of alate-based
(or primarily) reproductives in the incipient or mature colony. We also
included indirect information based on the genetic marker of workers if
the conclusion was monogamous pairing (e.g., (94)). This is because the
estimation of potentially multiple reproductives from genetic markers
cannot rule out the possibility of colony fusion of workers but not for
reproductives (95). We also included the behavioral observation of
colony foundation behavior, where some described the behavioral changes
facilitating monogamy, such as aggression or sealing the nest entrance
(e.g., (96, 97)). If most information was one type (monogamous or
multiple reproductives) and the other was rare or exceptional, we
treated this species as the majority type. On the other hand, if both
modes were observed equally, we recorded the species as multiple
reproductives. All information is summarized in Table S2.

We performed the ancestral state reconstruction for a mating system of
the incipient colony and mature colony separately, using only the taxa
with available information. We used a method similar to the
reconstruction of tandem running behavior described above. In both
cases, a simple ER model was the best fit over others.
