**Abstract**

Parthenogenesis and the loss of males have occurred repeatedly across
diverse organisms. Asexually reproducing lineages are not usually
associated with social animals that exhibit biparental care because such
care is inherently linked to the behavioral sequence of mate pairing and
sexual reproduction. The male-less lineages of the termite,
*Glyptotermes nakajimai*, provide a rare opportunity to study how sexual
reproduction can be lost in social animals with parental care. Here we
demonstrate that modification of the mate-pairing process predated the
evolution of asexual lineages. Termite colonies are typically founded by
a mating pair, with many species forming a tandem courtship pair while
searching for a nest site. Our comparative analysis of tandem running in
*Glyptotermes* termites revealed that two related species, *G. fuscus*
and *G. satsumensis*, exhibited both female-leader and male-leader
tandem runs, estimated to be the ancestral state in this genus. On the
other hand, tandem running was rare and ephemeral in both sexual and
asexual lineages of *G. nakajimai*. These results suggest that *G.
nakajimai* employs an alternative colony foundation strategy, as further
supported by their colony structures. Our study highlights the tight
link between the evolution of asexuality and behavioral preadaptation,
contributing to our understanding of the evolution of complex
phenotypes.

**Introduction**

Sexual reproduction is the norm for multicellular organisms despite the
costs of producing males \[1,2\]. Many studies have revealed the
advantages of sexual reproduction in short and long periods (e.g.,
\[3\]). Furthermore, in established sexual species, there are genetic
constraints to prevent the evolution of asexuality by maintaining a low
transition rate from sexual to asexual reproduction \[4\]. Therefore,
although asexual lineages evolved across the diversity of taxa, the
evolution of the asexual population is relatively rare. In addition to
genetic mechanisms, specific behaviors of sexual organisms can prevent
the evolution of asexual lineages, such as sexual conflicts \[5\] (but
see \[6\]). Among behavioral traits, the evolution of asexuality is
challenging in social animals with parental care because sexual
reproduction is associated with the sequence of mate pairing and
biparental care, where males contribute to fitness more than sperm
\[1,7\].

Termites evolved from the ancestor of subsocial cockroaches, and
colonies also started from subsocial pairs \[8,9\]. During a season of
the year, alates (winged reproductives) fly to disperse to find a mating
partner \[10\]. After shedding wings, many termite species form tandem
pairing; a female and a male walk together while searching for a nest
site \[11\]. In colony foundation processes, males significantly
contribute to the offspring energetically and through physical labor
\[12,13\], and thus, nest establishment as a single termite is not
usually successful \[14,15\]. Therefore, even if several termites have
parthenogenetic ability \[16,17\], they need a partner for colony
foundation. A species of drywood termite, *Glyptotermes nakajimai*
Morimoto (Isoptera: Kalotermitidae) \[18\], provides a unique
opportunity to study the evolution of asexual lineages in animals with
biparental care. In several populations, this species completely lost
males, and all colonies are comprised only of females (i.e., all-female
asexual societies) \[19\]. The evolution of this population requires the
modification of a typical monogamous colony foundation in termites.

Two different potential behavioral preadaptations enable the evolution
of a male-less colony foundation in termites. First, colony
establishment by female-female pairs after same-sex tandem runs. For
example, in *Reticulitermes* termites, same-sex tandem runs function as
heterosexual tandem runs \[11,20\], and female-female pairs start their
nests with parthenogenesis \[15,21\], although they are not very
successful in the long term \[22–24\]. If the ancestor of *G. nakajimai*
has strong tandem running behavior with same-sex pairing, they can
achieve the evolution of an asexual population without substantially
changing mate pairing behaviors. Second, pleometrosis (colony foundation
by multiple kings and queens \[25,26\]) can also facilitate the
evolution of an asexual society by securing the number of colony
foundation partners \[27\]. Actually, the colonies of *G. nakajimai* are
often headed by multiple reproductive \[19\]. However, how they achieve
such pleometrosis remains unknown; do they use ancestral tandem running
to form multiple pairs or completely modify the pairing process as
preadaptation?

In this study, we investigated the mate-pairing process of three
different *Glyptotermes* species (*G. nakajimai, G. fuscus, G.
satsumensis*) by confirming their phylogenetic relationship. These three
species can be found sympatrically and relatively related to each other
\[18,28\], but asexual society only arose in *G. nakajimai*. We
especially focused on tandem running behavior by automatically
quantifying it using the deep-leaning automated posture tracking
software \[29\]. We also estimated their phylogenetic relationship using
mitochondrial genomes. By mapping their ecological and colony structure
information on the phylogeny, we reconstruct the behavioral aspects of
the evolution of a male-less society.

**Methods**

*Termite collection*

We collected all termite colonies with a piece of nesting wood from the
field. We collected three colonies of *G. fuscus* (one in January 2021
and one in March 2022 in Nago, Okinawa; one in March 2023, Iriomote Is.,
Okinawa), three colonies of *G. satsumensis* in March 2021 (two in
Minamiosumi, Kagoshima, one in Kushima, Miyazaki), and four colonies of
*G. nakajimai* (two in March 2021, Wakasa, Fukui, one in April 2023,
Tokunoshima Is. Kagoshima, one in March 2021 in Cape Toi, Miyazaki). For
*G. nakajimai*, samples from Fukui and Tokunoshima Is. were sexual
\[30\], while the sample from Cape Toi was asexual \[19\]. The field
collection was performed before the swarming seasion; each colony
contained nymphs but not alates. All colonies were maintained within the
nesting wood at 22°C until the experiments. Before each experiment, we
transferred nests to a room at 27 °C, which promoted alates to emerge
and fly. Alates were then collected and separated individually. Tandem
running behavior happens after termites shed their wings. We used
individuals that shed their wings by themselves within 12 h.

Alates were then collected, separated by sex, and color-marked with one
dot of paint (PX-20; Mitsubishi) on the abdomen to distinguish sex
identities.

*Behavioral observations*

We introduced a female-male pair of termite dealates (female-female pair
for asexual population of *G. nakajimai*) to the experimental arena,
consisting of a petri dish (φ = 90 mm) covered with a layer of moistened
plaster. All pairs were prepared using nest mates. We recorded their
behavior up to 60 minutes at the rate of 30 frames per second. All the
videos were cropped to 1200x1200 pix to only include the arena in the
frame before the video analysis. In total, we observed 21 pairs of *G.
stsumensis* (340:16, 347:2, JP21-06:3), 46 pairs of *G. fuscus* (21A:16,
G05:18, NM2325:12), 25 pairs of *G. nakajimai* sexual populations
(356:6, 367:3, NM2344:16), and 15 pairs of asexual populations.

All videos were analyzed using SLEAP v 1.4.0 \[29\] to estimate the
movement of body parts of each individual. We used a 6-node skeleton:
antenna tips (LR), head (middle of mouth parts), head-pronotum boundary,
body center, abdomen-tip, and a dot of color painted marker. We built a
model for one species and then used it as a starting point to build
another for the next species sequentially. First, we labeled 342
individuals from 23 videos for training in *G. satsumensis*. We trained
a U-Net-based model with a multi-animal top-down approach, with a
receptive field size of 76 pixels for the centroid and 156 pixels for
the centered instance, on Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090, where augmentation is
done by rotating images from -180 to 180 degrees. The mean Average
Precision (mAP) and mean Average Recall (mAR) of this model were 0.36
and 0.49, respectively. While tracking after the inference, we used the
instance similarity method with the greedy matching method. All pose
estimation data were converted to HDF5 files for further analysis. In
*G. fuscus*, TBA.

We used Python to format all HDF5 files for further analysis and
converted them into FEATHER files for analysis in R \[31\]. We employed
a linear interpolation method to address missing values in the dataset.
After scaling all data from pixels to mm (1200 pixels = arena size), we
used a median filter with a kernel size of 5 to reduce noise.

To compare tandem running behaviors among species, we automatically
determined that pairs were in tandem or not based on the postures and
spatial position of partners. First, we regarded two individuals were in
interaction when the distance between body centers of partners was less
than two body lengthes, based on the frequency distribution of this
distance (Fig. 1C). In this process, we ignored the short interaction
events or non-interaction events less than 2 seconds to smooth the data.
Second, during interactions, we classified termite heading orientation
as female-leader and male-leader. We obtained heading directions of
females and males as vector from abdomen tips to head front. Then a pair
was in female-leader when male was behind relative to female heading
direction, and female was front relative to male heading direction, and
vice versa (Fig. 1AB). If a pair spent in female-leader position for
more than half of the time during an interaction event, we regarded that
the interaction event was female-leader tandem runs. This classified all
frames into female-leader tandem, male-leader tandem, other interactions
(including tandem runs where they switch leader-follower roles), and
non-interactions. We obtrained the traveled distance for which the
leader walked during each tandem running events. Then we compared this
traveled distance, using mixed-effects Cox models, with species being
treated as a fixed effect and each pair id as a random effect. We used
coxme() function in the coxme package in R \[32\]. Note that we used
distance instead of duration to evaluate how much tandem running pair
could explore the envronments by removing pausing time during
interactions.

**Idea of another result to be shown.**

I want to show that the colonies of G. nakajimai include many
reproductives (not a pair) \[19\], while colonies of G. fuscus and G.
satsumensis often have just monogamous pairs (often physogastric). This
is consistent with my observation, but my data is minimal as I have not
recorded it properly. The former is shown in the paper \[19\], but we do
not have published information on the latter.

Here are some possible approaches:

Based on this project report (you can read this in English from this
link:
<https://koara.lib.keio.ac.jp/xoonips/modules/xoonips/detail.php?koara_id=2018000005-20180253>),
G. satsumensis keeps monogamous pairing. However, this report is not
published (or looks like will not be published in the future). We may
reach out Hayashi-san to ask if he has any data about colony structures
in G. satsumensis. If so, we can ask if he can join this paper.

We can also reach out Yashiro-san if he have data.

Do you have any thoughts/ideas?

**Idea of Discussion**

Although most theoretical studies of the evolution of sexuality have
actually acknowledged that nonrandom mating or parental care may
infuence the outcome of their models, the importance of these phenomena
has always been minimized \[7\].

The resource limitations may have facilitated the evolutionary loss of
tandem runs and pleometrosis \[27\]. The distribution of G. nakajimai is
highly localized compared to G. fuscus or G. nakajimai. They are all
one-piece nester.
