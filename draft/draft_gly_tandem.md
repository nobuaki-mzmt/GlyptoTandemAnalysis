**Abstract**

Parthenogenesis and the loss of males have occurred repeatedly across
diverse organisms. Yet, asexually reproducing lineages are not usually
associated with social animals that exhibit biparental care because such
care is inherently linked to the behavioral sequence of mate pairing and
sexual reproduction. The male-less lineages of the termite,
*Glyptotermes nakajimai*, provide a rare opportunity to study how sexual
reproduction can be lost in social animals with parental care. Here we
demonstrate that modification of the mate-pairing process predated the
evolution of asexual lineages. Termite colonies are typically founded by
a mating pair, with many species forming a tandem courtship pair while
searching for a nest site. Our comparative analysis of tandem running in
*Glyptotermes* termites revealed that two related species, *G. fuscus*
and *G. satsumensis*, exhibited both female-leader and male-leader
tandem runs, estimated to be the ancestral state in this genus. On the
other hand, tandem running was rare and ephemeral in both sexual and
asexual lineages of *G. nakajimai*. These results suggest that *G.
nakajimai* employs an alternative colony foundation strategy, as further
supported by their colony structures. Our study highlights the tight
link between the evolution of asexuality and behavioral preadaptation,
contributing to our understanding of the evolution of complex
phenotypes.

**Introduction**

Sexual reproduction is the norm for multicellular organisms despite the
costs of producing males (1, 2). Many studies have revealed the
advantages of sexual reproduction in short and long periods (e.g., (3)).
Furthermore, in established sexual species, there are developmental and
genetic constraints, such as egg activation and inbreeding depression,
to prevent the evolution of asexuality by maintaining a low transition
rate from sexual to asexual reproduction (4). Therefore, although
asexual lineages evolved across the diversity of taxa, the evolution of
the asexual population is relatively rare. In addition to genetic
mechanisms, specific behaviors of sexual organisms can prevent the
evolution of asexual lineages, such as sexual conflicts (5) (but see
(6)). Among behavioral traits, the evolution of asexuality is
challenging in social animals with biparental care, where both males
contribute to parental care beyond providing sperm (1, 7). In such a
mating system, sexual reproduction is closely associated with the
sequence of mate pairing and parental care.

Termites evolved from the ancestor of wood-feeding cockroaches, whose
colonies are also initiated from subsocial pairs (8, 9). Mature termite
colonies synchronizedly release alates (winged reproductives), and
alates fly off to disperse and find a mating partner (10). After
shedding wings, many termite species form tandem pairing; a female and a
male walk together while searching for a nest site (11). During the
initial phases of colony foundation, males significantly contribute to
the offspring energetically and through physical labor (12, 13). Also,
survival and successful colony foundation only stem from pair formation
because termites require a partner for allogrooming (14, 15). Therefore,
although termite queens with parthenogenetic ability could, in theory,
reproduce alone (16–18), they need a partner for colony foundation.

One Japanese drywood termite, *Glyptotermes nakajimai* Morimoto
(Isoptera: Kalotermitidae) (19, 20), provides a rare opportunity to
study the evolution of asexual lineages in animals with biparental care.
In several populations, males have been completely lost, resulting in
all-female asexual societies (21), where the ancestral hybridization of
two sexual lineages gave rise to the asexual lineages (22). The
evolutionary loss of males in termite societies requires overcoming
several challenges. First, the ancestral sexual population must have had
the capacity for parthenogenesis (or tychoparthenogenesis—occasional egg
development without fertilization) as a preadaptation (23). While
tychoparthenogenesis is a canonical precursor to asexuality, it is not
sufficient on its own, given that many other termite species exhibit
parthenogenesis (or tychoparthenogenesis) without evolving into fully
asexual lineages (17, 24). Additionally, because biparental care is
integral to termite colony cycles, the transition to an asexual
population likely required modifications to the typical monogamous
colony foundation observed in termites.

Two potential behavioral preadaptations enable the evolution of a
male-less colony foundation in termites. (*i*) Same-sex tandem runs:
female-female pairs can establish colonies following same-sex tandem
running. In *Reticulitermes* termites, for example, such same-sex
tandems are as stable as heterosexual pairs (11, 25), and they can
initiate colonies via parthenogenesis (15, 26) though their long-term
success is limited (27–29). Same-sex tandem running varies widely across
species (30), implying that the ancestor of *G. nakajimai* lineages
might have exhibited strong tandem running behavior, including same-sex
pairing. Under this scenario, a transition of asexuality could have
occurred without changing mate pairing behaviors. (*ii*) Pleometrosis:
Colony foundation by multiple kings and queens can also facilitate the
evolution of an asexual society by securing sufficient colony foundation
partners (31). Under field conditions, *G. nakajimai* colonies are often
headed by multiple reproductives (21). However, the behavioral mechanism
of pleometrosis is unknown; do they use ancestral tandem running to form
multiple pairs, or do they modify the pairing process entirely as
preadaptation? If the latter, *G. nakajimai* may have lost tandem
running before the evolutionary loss of males. A comparative analysis of
tandem running behavior across *Glyptotermes* species can test these
ideas.

In this study, we investigated the mate-pairing process of three
different *Glyptotermes* species (*G. nakajimai, G. fuscus, G.
satsumensis*). These three species can be found sympatrically and
relatively related to each other (19, 32), but asexual society only
arose in *G. nakajimai*. We especially focused on tandem running
behavior by automatically quantifying it using the deep-leaning
automated posture-tracking software (33). We also estimated their
phylogenetic relationships and divergence times from mitochondrial
genomes. By mapping their ecological and colony structure information on
the phylogeny, we reconstruct the evolution of male-less societies
through the lens of behavior.

**Results and Discussion**

*The tandem pairing behavior in* Glyptotermes *species is diverse*

Tandem running behavior was clearly observed in *G. fuscus* and *G.
satsumensis*, while it was unclear in *G. nakajimai* from both sexual
and asexual populations (Figs. 1 and 2).

First, these species showed distinct patterns in pair positioning when
we observed behavioral interactions of mating pairs (or female-female
pairs in asexual populations) in a pest dish arena. When
species-specific datasets were pooled, pairs were often found to be
within two body length distances across all species, where data
distribution seemed to follow different patterns within or beyond two
body lengths (Fig. 1AC). It follows that termite dealates interact when
within two body lengths.

Second, when termites were within two body lengths, the spatial
orientations of pairs differed. In *G. satsumensis*, pairs were often
positioned in a line, with the female either in front or behind the male
(Fig. 1AB) —*i.e.*, they exhibit both female-led and male-led tandems.
In *G. fuscus*, similarly positioned in a line, tandems were more
frequently male-led (Fig. 1AC). In contrast, we could not observe a
clear positioning in *G. nakajimai*, with neither a leader nor a
follower, in either sexual or asexual populations (Fig. 1AB). We used
these observations for defining tandem runs; partners were in
interaction when the distance was within two body lengths, and during
interactions, pairs were in tandem runs when the female was in front of
the male and the male was behind the female (and vice versa).

Next, we looked into the details of the pairwise interactions for each
pair. Tandem running behavior was highly variable across different
pairs, even within species (Fig. 2A); some pairs showed tandem runs
during entire observations, while some did not form tandem runs during
the observation period. However, long tandem running (e.g., more than
40% of the observational time) was only observed in *G. satsumensis*
(7/21) and *G. fuscus* (8/46), not in *G. nakajimai*. There was no
significant difference in the proportion of the time for tandem running
behavior among species (GLMM, χ<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub> = 3.74, *P* =
0.291). Within each species, there were differences in the proportion of
time spent in tandem runs, where the female-led tandem run was more
common than male-led in *G. satsumensis* (GLMM,
χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 22.92, *P* \< 0.001), while male-led tandem
runnings were more common than female-led tandem runnings in *G. fuscus*
(χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 26118, *P* \< 0.001) or *G. nakajimai*
(χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 497.38, *P* \< 0.001). Thus, the male is
the more active sex (i.e., the follower) for pairing in *G.
satsumensis*, while the female is the more active sex for pairing in *G.
fuscus* and *G. nakajimai*.

*Sexual and asexual lineages of* G. nakajimai *do not maintain tandem
runs*

The function of tandem running behavior is to maintain pair cohesion
while exploring the environments for finding a nesting site. Therefore,
it should be evaluated as the distance a pair moved during a continuous
interacting event rather than the duration they spent in the posture of
following the other. When we compared the traveled distance, we found
that *G. satsumensis* and *G. fuscus* traveled a longer distance than
*G. nakajimai* (Fig. 2; Cox mixed effect model, male leader,
χ<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub> = 30.19, *P* \< 0.001, female leader,
χ<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub> = 17.56, *P* \< 0.001). In this sense,
although *G. nakajimai* showed ephemeral tandem runs, their
functionality is questioned —with their longest tandem breaking up after
running only 185 mm (sexual) and 260 mm (asexual). Given that these
species initiate their nest in tree branches, they cannot explore many
options during tandem running. On the other hand, tandem running of *G.
satsumensis* and *G. fuscus* can travel for more than 1000 mm long in 24
events continuously (15: *G. fuscus*, 9: *G. satsumensis*, from 16
pairs, 11: *G. fuscus*, 5: *G. satsumensis*). This allows them to
explore the tree branches thoroughly. Within these species, there were
no significant functional differences between female-led and male-led
tandem runs (Cox mixed effect model, *G. fuscus*;
χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 2.41, *P* = 0.121, *G. satsumensis*;
χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 0.14, *P* = 0.704).

*Ancestral state of tandem running behavior*

Tandem running behavior is highly variable in Kalotermitidae termites
(11). Genus-level ancestral state reconstruction and fossil record
suggested that the ancestor of Kalotermitidae exhibited tandem running
(11, 34). Yet, some species show tandem running, while others, even
within the same genus, do not. In *Glyptotermes*, *G. nakajimai* does
not show tandem running, while *G. fuscus* and *G. satsumensis* clearly
do (Fig. 2 and 3). These suggest two evolutionary scenarios of tandem
running behavior; 1) tandem running behavior can exhibit greater
evolvability and have evolutionary modifications more readily in
Kalotermitidae than the other lineage; 2) even with the high
evolvability, tandem pairing was lost before the evolution of male-less
society in *G. nakajimai*. We test these hypotheses using a comparative
phylogenetic framework. To reconstruct the evolutionary process of
tandem running, we performed the species-level ancestral state
reconstruction using the mitochondrial genome phylogeny and published
datasets.

By fitting various evolutionary models for tandem running evolution, we
found that the evolutionary rate of tandem running behavior is distinct
between Kalotermitidae (+ other basal lineages) and Neoisoptera,
representing two major termite groups in their diversity (Figure S1 and
4). The best-fit model was a hidden rate model (35), where the
female-leader state has two states: one can easily change its state,
while the other loses evolutionary variability (Figure S1). Although
female-leader tandem running can be observed in Kalotermitidae, these
female-leader tandems were estimated as an evolutionary variable, while
female-leader tandems in Neoisoptera were estimated to be evolutionarily
fixed (Figure S1). Thus, the tandem running behavior of Kalotermitidae
is indeed variable and readily experiences evolutionary changes, where
the ancestral state of Kalotermitidae might have tandem running but
cannot be clearly estimated (Figure S1 and 4); it lacked tandem running
in 32%, while it could exhibit tandem running in 68% either as female
leader (29%), male leader (11%), or both leader (28%). Note that this
information may be conservative as this lacks fossil evidence of tandem
running behavior of *Electrotermes affinis*, an extinct kalotermitid
termite with tandem running behavior (34).

Similar to the ancestor of Kalotermitidae, the ancestral state of
*Glyptotermes* was also ambiguous but more likely doing tandems (Figure
S1 and 4). The ancestral state was estimated as lacking tandem running
at 38%, while exhibiting tandem running at 62% either as female leader
(11%), male leader (2%), or both leader (42%). However, the ancestral
state of *G. nakajimai* was clearly estimated as lacking tandem running
behavior in 93% (Figures S1 and 4). Therefore, we conclude that the loss
of tandem pairing should have predated the evolution of male-less
society in *G. nakajimai* (Figure 1).

*Evolution of the mating system co-work with the loss of tandem running
toward a male-less society*

In *G. nakajimai*, colonies often include many alate-derived
reproductives in both sexual and asexual populations (21). Colony
foundation by multiple queens has been observed in asexual populations
(no data is available in sexual populations) (21). Such pleometrosis
(colony foundation by more reproductives than a pair) may have
contributed to removing a barrier to the evolution of asexuality as they
can achieve alloparental care without males (Figure 1). To investigate
how such pleometrosis (or having multiple primary reproductives) is
distributed among termite diversity and contributes to the evolution of
a male-less society, we also performed phylogenetic comparative analyses
of the mating systems (Figure 4). We checked the colony structure of *G.
fuscus* and *G. satsumensis* from field observations (Table S1). Also,
we compiled information about the number of reproductives in the nest
for the species with the available tandem running information by
performing a systematic search of the literature (Table S2).

First, in *Glyptotermes*, mature colonies of *G. fuscus* and *G.
satsumensis* often included multiple reproductives (Table S1), with
sexual populations of *G. nakajimai* having more reproductives than
asexual populations or *G. fuscus* (GLM, χ<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub> =
140, *P* \< 0.001, *G. satsumensis* was excluded from statistical
analyses due to limited sample size). However, the source of such
multiple reproductives in mature colonies could have differed from *G.
nakajimai* and the other two species. A previous study showed that
incipient colonies of *G. nakajimai* already had multiple queens (21)
(pair: 1/4), while incipient colonies of *G. fuscus* or *G. satsumensis*
were monogamous pairs (pair: 4/4, Table 1). Colony fusion could explain
the occurrence of multiple reproductives in mature nests after initial
colony foundations by independent monogamous pairs in the same branch.
However, colony fusion often causes competition between reproductives
and results in pair formation in many other species (e.g., (14, 36,
37)). In this sense, *Glyptotermes* termites might be tolerant to the
presence of other reproductive, which may have played a role in
facilitating the evolution of pleometrosis in this group.

Next, this observation in *Glyptotermes* species is further supported by
a large-scale comparative analysis of the mating systems (Figure 4 and
Table S2). Having multiple reproductives in the colony is actually rare
across termite diversity. Pleometrosis has been observed in several
species of Termitidae (38–40). However, even in these species, both
monogamous and pleometrosis can be observed in a mixed way, highlighting
the uniqueness of *Glyptotermes* which has multiple primary
reproductives in most colonies. In Kalotermitidae, the available records
show that primary reproductives were usually in monogamous pairs (e.g.,
(41, 42)) (Figure 4), and the ancestral state of Kalotermitidae was
estimated as monogamous in both the colony foundation stage and mature
colonies (Figure 4). On the other hand, the ancestral state of
*Glyptotermes* was estimated to have multiple primary reproductives in
mature colonies (Figure 4). So, within *Glyptotermes* termites, there
was a correlation between pair formation behavior and colony foundation
unit in the studied species; *G. fuscus* and *G. satsumensis* exhibited
tandem running and monogamous colony foundation (Fig. 2, Table 1), while
*G. nakajimai* lacked them (Fig. 2). The combination of characteristics
of tandem running and the mating system was unique in *G. nakajimai*,
which lacked tandem running, started colonies from multiple
reproductives, and had the ability of parthenogenesis (Fig. 4). In this
group. The modification of pair formation (lack of tandem run and
pleometrosis) should have predated the male-less society (Figs 1 and 4).

It remains unclear whether tandem pair formation necessarily leads to
monogamous pairing. For example, although some other Kalotermitidae
species (e.g., *Neotermes, Pterotermes, Cryptotermes*) lack tandem
running behavior (43–45), these showed strict monogamous pairing (41,
42). On the other hand, we speculate that loss of tandem running should
be the prerequisite to achieving pleometrosis as a default unit as in
*G. nakajimai*. Tandem running behavior is essentially a pairing
behavior and runs with more than three individuals are unstable (11, 25,
46). For example, in Macrotermitinae termites, such as *Odontotermes* or
*Macrotermes*, it is relatively common to find colonies with more than
two primary reproductives (38) (Table S2). Yet, in these species,
monogamous pairing is also common. In either situation, resource
limitation should facilitate pleometrosis (31). When the nesting site is
a limited and valuable resource, termite dealates must concentrate and
be forced to start a colony with many individuals. Actually, the
distribution of *G. nakajimai* is highly localized, this species is
usually rarer than other species and can be found within the narrow area
near the tips of the capes (especially in asexual populations).
Pleometrosis observed in *G. nakajimai* may have been due to their
particular requirements as a site of colony foundation.

***Conclusion***

Add discussion like with tandem running, it may be difficult to obtain
male-less society because males prevent only female pairing.

Parthenogenesis ability has evolved independently many times in termites
(17, 18, 24), but asexual society only happens in *G. nakajimai* as far
as we know. We attributed this rarity to the complex combination of
required preadaptations, including females being active sex (Fig. 1),
lack of tandem running (Fig. 2), and pleometrosis. For example,
*Reticulitermes* termites and several other termites incorporate
facultative parthenogenesis into their colony reproductive system and
life history (24, 47). Also, these species show female-female pairing
and colony foundation (48), although female-female pairs do not result
in functional colonies in a long timeline (27, 28). These species
ultimately use strict social monogamy, where the presence of multiple
kings or queens leads to competition and a monogamous pair. Also, male
is the active sex of tandem pairing, which might hinder the evolution of
asexuality. Similarly, *Neotermes sugioi* shows facultative
parthenogenesis and even lacks tandem running behavior (43, 49).
However, this species also shows strict monogamous pairing.

Sexual reproduction is the norm in animal kingdoms, and the evolution of
asexuality does not happen randomly across lineages because each group
has a specific unique hurdle to overcome during male loss (2, 4). Many
theoretical studies of the evolution of sexuality have acknowledged that
parental care by males can minimize the cost of sexual reproduction.
Thus, evolutionary change of behavior should accompany such species. In
this study, we showed that mate pairing behavior went through several
steps of preadaptations in the course of the evolutionary loss of males
in a termite, *G. nakajimai*. This highlights the importance of
behavioral preadaptation as a prerequisite for the evolution of
sexuality in social animals. By focusing on the behavioral aspects of
sexual and asexual evolution, our results shed light on the integrative
approach to the evolution of the sex.

**Methods**

*Termite collection*

We collected all termite colonies with a piece of nesting wood from the
field. We collected three colonies of *G. fuscus* in Okinawa Prefecture
(one in January 2021 and one in March 2022 in Nago; one in March 2023,
Iriomote Is.), three colonies of *G. satsumensis* in March 2021 (two in
Minamiosumi, Kagoshima, one in Kushima, Miyazaki), and four colonies of
*G. nakajimai* (two in March 2021, Wakasa, Fukui, one in April 2023,
Tokunoshima Is. Kagoshima, one in March 2021 in Cape Toi, Miyazaki). The
populations of *G. nakajimai* from Fukui prefecture and Tokunoshima
Island are sexually reproducing (50), while the Cape Toi population is
asexually reproducing (21). The field collection was performed before
the swarming season in March-June, depending on the location (19, 50);
each colony contained nymphs but not alates. All colonies were
maintained within the nesting wood at 22°C until the experiments. Before
each experiment, we transferred nests to a room at 27 °C, which promoted
alates to emerge and fly. Nests were also opened with axes, and flying
alates were collected. Alates were induced to shed their wings by
manually pinching their wings with forceps. Dealates were maintained in
Petri dishes containing moist, unwoven cloth in the light and used for
the experiments within one day of flight. Dealates were separated by sex
and color-marked with one dot of paint (PX-20; Mitsubishi) on the
abdomen to distinguish sex identities.

*Behavioral observations*

We introduced a female-male pair of termite dealates (female-female pair
for an asexual population of *G. nakajimai*) to the experimental arena,
consisting of a petri dish (φ = 90 mm) covered with a layer of moistened
plaster. All pairs were prepared using nest-mates. The effect of
intracolonial and intercolonial pairing on tandem running behavior is
not known for *Glyptotermes* species. We consistently used nest-mate
pairing for valid cross-species comparisons. Note that tandem running is
not different between nestmate and non-nestmate pairing in
*Reticulitermes speratus* (11). This species is not closely related to
*Glyptotermes*, so we cannot fully rule out the possibility that the
nestmate and non-nest mate showed different tandem running. However, our
species comparison is at least consistent across species by using only
nest-mate pairing. We recorded their behavior for up to 60 minutes at 30
frames per second. Videos were cropped to 1200x1200 pixels to include
only the arena in the frame before the video analysis. In total, we
observed 21 pairs of *G. satsumensis* (340:16, 347:2, JP21-06:3), 46
pairs of *G. fuscus* (21A:16, G05:18, NM2325:12), 25 pairs of *G.
nakajimai* sexual populations (356:6, 367:3, NM2344:16), and 15 pairs of
asexual populations.

All videos were analyzed using SLEAP v 1.4.0 (33) to estimate the
movement of body parts of each individual. We used a 6-node skeleton:
antenna tips (LR), head (middle of mouth parts), head-pronotum boundary,
body center, abdomen-tip, and a dot of a color-painted marker. We built
a model for one species and then used it as a starting point to build
another for the next species sequentially. First, we labeled 342
individuals from 23 videos for training in *G. satsumensis*. We trained
a U-Net-based model with a multi-animal top-down approach, with a
receptive field size of 76 pixels for the centroid and 156 pixels for
the centered instance, on Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090, where augmentation is
done by rotating images from -180 to 180 degrees. The mean Average
Precision (mAP) and mean Average Recall (mAR) of this model were 0.36
and 0.49, respectively. While tracking after the inference, we used the
instance similarity method with the greedy matching method. All pose
estimation data were converted to HDF5 files for further analysis. Then,
we used the model for *G. satsumensis* as a starting point and developed
a model for *G. fuscus* with 956 individuals from 37 videos. This model
was further fine-tuned by only using labels for each colony. Similarly,
the models of *G. nakajimai* were trained based on this *G. fuscus*
model for each colony.

We used Python to format all HDF5 files for further analysis and
converted them into FEATHER files for analysis in R (51). We employed a
linear interpolation method to address missing values in the dataset.
After scaling all data from pixels to mm (1200 pixels = arena size), we
used a median filter with a kernel size of 5 to reduce noise.

To compare tandem running behaviors among species, we automatically
determined whether pairs were in tandem based on the postures and
spatial position of partners. First, we regarded as two individuals
being in interaction when the distance between the body centers of
partners was less than two body lengths, based on the frequency
distribution of this distance (Fig. 1C). In this process, we ignored the
short interaction events or non-interaction events less than 2 seconds
to smooth the data. Second, during interactions, we classified termite
heading orientation as female-leader and male-leader. We obtained the
heading directions of females and males as vectors from the abdomen tips
to the head front. Then, a pair was in the female leader when the male
was behind relative to the female heading direction, and the female was
front relative to the male heading direction, and vice versa (Fig. 1AB).
If a pair spent more than half of the time in a female-leader position
during an interaction event, we regarded the interaction event as a
female-leader tandem run. This classified all frames into female-leader
tandem, male-leader tandem, other interactions (including tandem runs
where they switch leader-follower roles), and non-interactions. We
obtained the traveled distance for which the leader walked during each
tandem running event. Then, we compared this traveled distance, using
mixed-effects Cox models, with species being treated as a fixed effect
and each pair id as a random effect. We used the coxme() function in the
coxme package in R (52). Note that we used distance instead of duration
to evaluate how much tandem running pair could explore the environments
by removing pausing time during interactions.

*Molecular data processing*

We used mitochondrial genomes to reconstruct termites’ calibrated
phylogenetic trees with a focus on species and lineages with reviewed
data on tandem runs (11), while also encompassing all recognized extant
families and subfamilies *sensu* Hellemans *et al*. (53), Most
mitochondrial genomes used in this study have been previously published
(54–74) (Table S3).

We sequenced six additional samples from species with data on tandem
runs (Table SX1). Specimens were collected in Japan and preserved in
absolute ethanol stored at -20°C until DNA extraction. DNA was extracted
using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue extraction kit (Qiagen). Libraries were
prepared using the NEBNext Ultra™ II FS DNA Library Preparation Kit
(New England Biolabs) and the Unique Dual Indexing Kit (New England
Biolabs), with reagent volumes reduced to one-fifteenth of the
recommended volumes. Libraries were pooled in equimolar concentration,
and paired-end sequenced on the Novaseq platform at a read length of 150
bp.

Raw reads were trimmed from adapters and low-quality bases using fastp
*v*0.20.1 (75). Trimmed reads were assembled using metaSPAdes *v*3.13
(76), and mitochondrial scaffolds were identified and annotated using
MitoFinder *v*1.4 (77). The six mitogenomes produced herein were
deposited in GenBank under accessions XXX-XXX.

*Phylogenetic reconstructions*

Annotated mitochondrial features were separately aligned. For the 13
mitochondrial protein-coding genes, we translated DNA sequences into the
corresponding amino acid sequences using the transeq function from
EMBOSS *v*6.6.0 (78) and aligned protein sequences with MAFFT *v*7.305
(79). Protein alignments were back-translated into codon alignments
using PAL2NAL *v*14 (80). The two rRNA and 22 tRNA mitochondrial genes
were aligned as DNA sequences. All alignments were concatenated in a
supermatrix using FASconCAT-G_v1.04.pl (81). The mitochondrial
supermatrix was separated into five distinct partitions: combined rRNAs,
combined tRNAs, and combined first, second, and third codon positions of
protein-coding genes.

Time-calibrated phylogenetic trees (~~with and~~ without the third codon
positions partition) were reconstructed using BEAST v2.6.2 (82). Trees
and clock models were set as linked, while site models were kept
unlinked. A GTR+G model of nucleotide substitution was selected for all
partitions. The trees were given a Yule speciation process as prior. An
uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock was used to model rate variation
among branches (83). We used 12 fossils as minimum age constraints
(Table S4). Fossil calibrations were implemented as exponential priors
on node time with a 97.5% soft maximum bound (84). Minimum age
constraints and soft maximum bounds were obtained from PaleoBioDB
(<https://paleobiodb.org>; last accessed: 25/02/12). Additionally, we
constrained the (i) monophyly of Macrotermitinae + Sphaerotermitinae and
non-Macrotermitinae non-Sphaerotermitinae Termitidae, (ii) the
sistership of Stylotermitidae to all extant Neoisoptera, to match the
topology retrieved by genome-scale reconstructions (53, 62, 85). Markov
Chain Monte Carlo analyses were run for a total of 500 million
generations. Trees and parameters were sampled every 50,000 steps. We
visually inspected the trace file with Tracer v1.7 (86) and accordingly
used a burn-in of 20%. Maximum clade credibility trees with median
heights were obtained using TreeAnnotator (Supplementary Data 2 and 3).

*Ancestral state reconstruction of tandem running*

A previous study performed the ancestral state reconstruction of tandem
running behavior at the genus level (11). In this study, we extended
this reconstruction to the species level to infer the evolutionary
history of tandem running in *Glyptotermes*. We basically used the
dataset summarized in the previous study (11) with new information on
*Glyptotermes* species observed here (Figure X) but included several
modifications. First, we included *Hodotermopsis sjostedti*, which
exhibited tandem running with both females and males being leaders.
Second, we treated *Mastotermes darwiniensis* as lacking tandem running.
The tandem running of this species is based on the observation of
workers, which is not the same as the sexual behavior. Also, dealates of
this species does not show tandem running behavior. Note that treating
this species as tandem running with both female and male doing leader
did not change our conclusion. Finally, in the dataset of the previous
study (11), some species show tandem running but lack the information of
the leader. We gave arbitrary values for these taxa, female-leader for
neoisopteran termites, and both-leader for other termites. The former is
based on the fact that all other neoisopteran termites show
female-leader tandem running. The later is rather arbitrary, but
treating these as female-leader tandem running (which is more common in
termites in general) did not change our conclusions.

We carried out ancestral-state reconstructions by coding tandem running
behavior in four different states, without tandem running, female-leader
tandem running, male-leader tandem running, and tandem running with both
sexes being a leader. Another potential approach is to consider the two
different characteristics of female and male leaders. However, our
preliminary analysis with the function pageltest() shows that these two
characters are dependent (result here). In this case, the combination of
these two different states can be regarded as the same as the four-state
model, and thus, we stick with the four-state model.

Observing the diversity of termite tandem running behavior, a clear
pattern is that all neoisopteran termites exhibit female-leader tandem
runs, while tandem running is variable in other lineages (Fig.) (11).
This can be because neoisopteran termites developed a female-specific
sex pheromone that may make the evolutionary change of the sexual leader
role less likely. On the other hand, in other lineages, sex roles can
easily evolutionarily change, or tandem can even sometimes lose, as they
do not have sex-specific pheromones (ref). Therefore, we assume that
female-leader state has a hidden state (35), where one can easily change
their state, while the other loses evolutionary variability. We used a
hidden rate model to account for this issue (35).

We fitted a variety of models to examine the most feasible evolutionary
scenario. We fitted simple models without any hidden states, and with
different state transition patterns, all rates different model (‘ARD’
model) to allow independent estimates for transitions to and from the
three states; the all rates equal model (‘ER’ model), and a model
assuming symmetrical transition rates between states (“SYM” model’) to
estimate the ancestral state of this discrete trait. We used the fitMk()
function (pi = fitzjohn) of the R package “phytools” (87). In addition,
we developed two hidden rate models, one with only female leader tandem
having hidden states and one with all traits having hidden states. We
used the ER model for the pattern of state transition. We used the
function fitHRM (pi = fitzjohn) in the same “phytools” package. The
Akaike information criterion (AICc) was used to compare models.

*Mating system*

Although termite colonies typically started from a monogamous pair, *G.
nakajimai* colonies often include multiple reproductives (21). To relate
the evolutionary process of tandem running with colony foundation
strategies, we performed the phylogenetic comparative analysis of mating
systems. We investigated if colonies of each termite species have a
monogamous pair (a king and a queen) or multiple reproductives. Even if
termite colonies started from a monogamous pair, the number of
reproductives can change over time due to, e.g., colony fusion. Thus, we
investigated the number of reproductives at two stages: during colony
foundation (or incipient colony) and mature colonies.

In termite colonies, there are two types of reproductives: adult
reproductives derived from alates, and neotenic, supplementary
reproductives only differentiated from the offspring of colony founders.
Adult reproductives usually originate from the colony founders. Thus, we
only focus on the number of adult reproductives in the colonies. Note
that there are several exceptional examples of adultoids, which are
supplemental reproductives derived from alates (88). Therefore, multiple
reproductives in mature colonies can either reflect pleometrosis (colony
foundation by multiple reproductives), colony fusion, or supplementary
adultoids.

We obtained the number of reproductives of *G. satsumensis* and *G.
fuscus* from the field observations in the same method as the previous
study (21). <span class="mark">Colonies were collected \~\~~</span>. In
addition, we conducted a literature survey on the species whose
information on tandem running is available (11). On the 15th and 16th of
March 2025, we used the online reference platform Google Scholar with
the simple string function and search strings: (Genus-name Species-name)
AND (reproductives OR king OR queen OR foundation). We used Google
Scholar to collect as much observational information on the number of
reproductives as possible. We focused on the field observations
reporting the number of alate-based (or primarily) reproductives, either
in the incipient colony or mature colony. However, we also included
indirect information based on the genetic marker of workers if the
conclusion was monogamous pairing (e.g., (89)). This is because the
estimation of potentially multiple reproductives from genetic markers
cannot rule out the possibility of colony fusion of workers but not for
reproductives (90). We also included the behavioral observation of
colony foundation behavior, where some described the behavioral changes
facilitating monogamy, such as aggression or sealing the nest entrance
(e.g., (91, 92)). If most information was one type (monogamous or
multiple reproductives) and the other was very rare or exceptional, we
treated this species as the majority type. On the other hand, if both
modes were observed equally, we recorded the species as both monogamous
and multiple reproductives. All information is summarized in Table S2.

We performed the ancestral state reconstruction for a mating system of
the incipient colony and mature colony separately, using only the taxa
with available information. We used a method similar to the
reconstruction of tandem running behavior described above. In both
cases, a simple ER model was the best fit.
